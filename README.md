A simple script to calculate the musical intervals when connecting two triads.

## Chord tensions
Major Triad:

Available Tensions:
9 (2)
#11 (#4)
13 (6)
Avoid Notes:
b9 (b2)
11 (4)
b13 (b6)
Minor Triad:

Available Tensions:
9 (2)
11 (4)
13 (6)
Avoid Notes:
b9 (b2)
#11 (#4)
b13 (b6)
Augmented Triad:

Available Tensions:
b9 (b2)
9 (2)
#9 (#2)
11 (4)
#11 (#4)
Avoid Notes:
13 (6)
b13 (b6)
Diminished Triad:

Available Tensions:
Any note a half-step above a triad tone (e.g., Cdim7 can use D, F, Ab)
Avoid Notes:
None (within the half-step rule)

## To Do:
Four-note chords
Correct enharmonic equivalents
Correct intervals (#4 instead of b5)
